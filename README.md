# Bartender 2 #
  
This is the final version of Bartender 2 released for Vanilla. Also included are extra modules that add both extremely useful functions and cosmetic changes.  
  
## Installation  
Unzip **Bartender2-Read-Instructions-master.zip** into a temporary folder (not your addons folder) and then open that folder.  
Select the **Bartender2** folder and the folders for any of the modules you wish to use, copy these to your addons folder.  
You can now delete the tempory folder.

## Modules
### I’d recommend FuBartender2, Pagemaster and Dreamlayout as a starting point.

**FuBartender2** - the default way to configure Bartender is by typing a lot of tedious commands, this will add an icon to you minimap with a useful config menu. 
Unless you’re already using [Niagra](https://github.com/laytya/Niagara) you’ll definitely want this.


**Pagemaster** - Atl, Shift, Ctrl paging on bar 1.  
**HunterBars** - switches your main and melee bar when you get too close to an enemy.  
**Druid Bar** - bar switching for druids when prowling.  
**Shadow Bar** - priest's shadow form switching.  
**BindingSwap** - swaps the keybindings amongst the bars.  

### Cosmetic modules  
**Dreamlayout** -  the default buttons have the icon image all the way to the edge, this module adds a small border.  
**Circled** - round buttons.  
  
 
 ### Things you almost certain don't want
**SpeedPad n52** - only included for the sake of completeness, it was aimed at people using the Belkin Nostromo N52 SpeedPad.
